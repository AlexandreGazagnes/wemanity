# wemanity

Here you will find the work done as part of a recruitment process for wemanity. These projects are related to the kata codes: https://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/.

2 projects were carried out:

- argparse : which is a very short and simple project. It is a module for managing the arguments of a program launched in CLI. In python, there is a module named 'argparse' https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html that does exactly this job (and is done for) but I preferred to code from scratch an other script rather than just importing the built-in module.

- game-of-life which is a project more complex whatever that of an intermediary level, it is of my vision of the game of life of conway which is one of the most known cellular automata : https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/. Initially it was not asked to code the whole game of life but one thing bringing another the project is so far almost complete.
