#Â argpase


Please find here my work about argparse kata code.

my_argparse.py is a module with one function 'my_parser', wich is a parser for CLI arguments. 

In this work, I choose to not import the magic package named 'argparse' wich provide a full and fancy framework to handle CLI arguments, considering that it would be a cheating way for answering to the problem, so you will find a CLI arguments parser designed at purpose 'from scratch'.

test_my_argparse.py is the test script attached (please use 'pytest -v').
