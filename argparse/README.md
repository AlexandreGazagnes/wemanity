please find here my work about agrparse kata code.

argparse.py is a module with one function 'argparse', wich is a parser of CLI arguments. In this work, we do not have imported the magic package named 'argparse' wich provide a full and fancy framework to handle CLI arguments, considering that it would be a cheating way for answering to the problem. You will find a CLI arguments parser designed 'from scratch'.

test_argparse.py is the test script attached (please use 'pytest -v').
